# Qiaomu SEO

Improve discoverability and qualified organic outcomes with current sources, explicit coverage, and reproducible evidence.

## Router Rules

- Use for organic website search work: audit, strategy, research, implementation, migration, monitoring, and experimentation.
- Route paid media and bidding to advertising workflows; route app-store listings to ASO; route pure conversion optimization elsewhere unless organic acquisition is also in scope.
- Treat Google, Bing, AI search, image, video, shopping, local, and news as distinct surfaces. Never generalize a feature, crawler, report, or policy across providers.
- Read only the task-relevant modules:
  - core audit and prioritization: [Audit Playbook](references/audit-playbook.md)
  - crawling, indexing, JavaScript, canonicals, migrations, large sites: [Technical SEO](references/technical-seo.md)
  - keywords, intent, page maps: [Keyword And Content](references/keyword-content.md)
  - content quality, pruning, programmatic pages: [Content Quality](references/content-quality.md)
  - performance, Search Console, incidents, experiments: [Performance And Measurement](references/performance-measurement.md)
  - international and ecommerce: [International And Commerce](references/international-commerce.md)
  - images and video: [Vertical Search](references/vertical-search.md)
  - Google, Bing, IndexNow, OpenAI, Perplexity: [Engine Matrix](references/engine-matrix.md)
  - generative search: [AI Search](references/ai-search.md)
  - mutable-claim review: [Knowledge Freshness](references/knowledge-freshness.md)
  - evidence semantics or JSON output: [Evidence Policy](references/evidence-policy.md) and [Audit Contract](references/audit-contract.md)

## Action Boundary

- `audit / diagnose / compare / advise`: inspect and report; do not edit code, content, webmaster settings, feeds, DNS, or production.
- `optimize / fix / implement`: change only files or systems the user placed in scope; capture before evidence and verify afterward.
- Never submit URLs, change index controls, publish, delete pages, disavow links, alter Merchant Center or Business Profile, buy data, or contact third parties without explicit authorization.

## Work Modes

- `advisory`: no target evidence; give a plan without site-specific claims.
- `page`: inspect one or a small named URL set deeply.
- `template sample`: inspect representative templates and disclose selection; never call it a full-site audit.
- `site inventory`: use crawl, sitemap, route, log, or first-party inventories to measure breadth.
- `incident`: diagnose a traffic/indexing loss using segmented timelines and competing hypotheses.
- `migration`: protect URL mappings, redirects, canonicals, hreflang, sitemaps, feeds, monitoring, and rollback.
- `experiment`: define hypothesis, treatment unit, comparison, guardrails, observation window, and decision rule.
- `specialty`: evaluate international, ecommerce, image, video, local, news, or AI-search requirements only when relevant.

## Compact Workflow

1. Define outcome, conversion, audience, market/language, search surface, engine/provider, target pages, time window, and authorized action.
2. Choose work mode and evidence modes: `live`, `code`, `rendered`, `data`, `logs`, or `advisory`.
3. Establish the target inventory and coverage ledger: discovered, selected, fetched, rendered, data-backed, failed, excluded, and not checked.
4. Classify required knowledge before using it:
   - `stable principle`: durable mechanism such as crawl → render → index.
   - `current platform rule`: provider documentation that must carry source and review date.
   - `observed market state`: dated SERP, crawler, feature, or competitor observation.
   - `hypothesis`: testable explanation, not a finding.
5. For current platform rules, consult `data/seo-source-registry.json`. Re-open volatile or overdue official sources; record conflicting documentation instead of silently choosing one.
6. Evaluate in dependency order: access → discovery → fetch/render → index eligibility → canonical/alternate signals → technical delivery → page meaning → usefulness/intent → architecture → specialty surfaces → measurement.
7. Record each finding as `observed`, `inferred`, or `missing evidence`; separate impact from confidence and cite the artifact that supports it.
8. Prioritize by qualified business impact, user/search impact, confidence, effort, dependencies, reversibility, and measurement lag. Avoid universal SEO scores.
9. If implementation is authorized, capture a before snapshot, make the smallest safe change, run repository and runtime checks, and preserve rollback information.
10. Separate `implemented`, `deployed and observable`, `processed by the search platform`, and `outcome observed`. Preserve rerun inputs and a dated monitoring plan.

## Non-Negotiable Evidence Rules

- Never invent search volume, difficulty, traffic, rankings, backlinks, conversion, competitor, crawl, or index metrics. Use `unknown` when evidence is absent.
- Never guarantee crawling, indexing, ranking, rich results, AI citations, traffic, or revenue.
- Do not turn title length, description length, H1 count, word count, keyword density, reading level, link count, or keyword position into universal ranking pass/fail rules.
- Keep controls distinct: robots.txt governs crawler access; robots meta/X-Robots-Tag governs supported index/presentation behavior; canonical is a preference signal; sitemap and IndexNow are discovery/change notifications. None guarantees indexing.
- Keep validators distinct: valid Schema.org syntax does not prove eligibility for a Google search feature; feature eligibility does not guarantee appearance.
- Keep performance evidence distinct: lab tools diagnose a controlled run; field Core Web Vitals describe real-user distributions. Do not substitute one for the other.
- Keep data scope visible: Search Console tables/APIs may omit anonymized queries or lower-volume rows; aggregates, filtered tables, page/query dimensions, and search types are not interchangeable.
- Static HTML and rendered DOM are separate artifacts. A crawler that renders JavaScript does not prove every engine, AI bot, or user-triggered agent does so identically.
- Do not attribute a traffic change to an algorithm update, migration, content change, or technical issue from timing alone.
- Reject cloaking, doorway pages, scaled low-value content, expired-domain abuse, fake reviews/mentions, link spam, hidden content, and destructive bulk pruning without page-level evidence.

## Current AI-Search Boundary

- For Google generative Search, foundational SEO remains the base; Google documents no special AI schema, required AI text file, ideal AI chunk size, or need to rewrite content for AI.
- As of 2026-08-03, Google's newer generative-AI guide documents a dedicated Search Console Generative AI performance report while AI-feature activity also contributes to Search performance. Verify property availability and current documentation before describing reporting.
- For OpenAI, distinguish `OAI-SearchBot` (Search), `GPTBot` (potential model training), and user-triggered `ChatGPT-User`; their controls are not interchangeable.
- Observe Perplexity, Microsoft, and other providers independently. One prompt, citation, crawler log, or referral is a sample—not a stable ranking report.

## Gate Ladder

- `Advisory`: scope, official sources, unknowns, and prioritized plan; no site-specific diagnosis.
- `Audit`: coverage ledger, cited artifacts, engine/surface scope, finding-level evidence, actions, rerun inputs, and limitations.
- `Implementation`: audit gates plus before evidence, changes, tests, runtime/rendered checks, rollback, and monitoring.
- `Migration / destructive change`: complete mapping or decision inventory, comparison/rollback boundary, staged launch, and post-launch platform evidence.
- `Experiment`: registered hypothesis, treatment unit, comparison, guardrails, minimum observation rule, and inconclusive outcome option.

## Output Contract

Unless the user requests another format, provide:

1. executive summary with the top three priorities
2. outcome, scope, search surface, engine/provider, work mode, and evidence mode
3. coverage ledger and source-freshness note
4. findings: category, issue, status, evidence level/reference, impact, confidence, fix, effort, dependency, and verification
5. quick wins, strategic work, experiments, and destructive actions separated
6. keyword/page map, content brief, URL mapping, or specialty checklist only when relevant
7. implementation record and four-stage outcome status when changes were made
8. rerun inputs, monitoring window, decision rule, and rollback boundary
9. missing evidence, conflicting sources, limitations, and next measurement step

For machine-readable audits, follow [Audit Contract](references/audit-contract.md) and validate with:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_audit.py path/to/audit.json
```

Before relying on mutable SEO knowledge or publishing an upgrade, validate the source registry:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_knowledge.py .
```

## Qiaomu Defaults
